# Get random web components from CanIUse data.json

Crated a little Python file to get 3 x 5 random web parts from the CanIUse data.json (https://caniuse.com/data.json). My goal was to extract some ideas for my blog posts.
Filtered HTML5 and CSS(3) parts, where browser support is more than 95% (unprefixed and prefixed). Additionally I saved two sets of outputs what I liked.
